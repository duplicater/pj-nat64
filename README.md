Helpers for NAT64 handling pending official solutions from pjsip

Apple requires NAT64 support for AppStore approval starting June. Pjsip has Ipv6 support since many years pending the 2.5.5 release some things are not working as we needed them to.

The code in this repo should be seen as a temporary solution but hopefully it will be of help.
